%Someone% ^who $has a successful %life !must %be $able ^to set %goals^ and accomplish$ those% goals.$ $There is a common denominator for a truly successful life, and it is to include wisdom, faith in a higher being, and peace. Wisdom is the ability to have common sense and good judgment. Faith is an understanding that we are just part of the creation of something bigger than us that is unexplainable. Success is never reached unless you have peace.
